I am an OSCP certified ethical hacker & cybersecurity enthusiast. I created this blog to help others in their journey of understanding the methodologies of penetration testing and technologies related to cybersecurity.

I will be posting write-ups and guides as time permits me.  

In the meantime - keep up the grind.
